This repository was created for Berserker@Quake2 porting for Linux.

Warning: Bers@Q2 is my First Project, started in 2005 year, I was young and inexperienced. So, programming style is very bad ))) But game works nice!

Don't see to .cpp extension, project uses almost pure C.

Main.cpp - main source code for berserker.exe

Game.cpp - main source code for game.dll

Data.h - all data for berserker.exe

GameData.h - all data for game.dll

Def.h - all definitions for berserker.exe and game.dll

Not forget: case sencitivites of file and directory names...
